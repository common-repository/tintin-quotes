== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did I make this plugin? =

News of the Spielberg / Peter Jackson Tintin movie sent a torrent of happy boyhood memories through my head. A long spelunking of the internet culminated in a line by line reading of Captain Haddocks' famous insults. So I finally scratched my WordPress plug-in itch and created the little WordPress widget you see on your blog. 

= I want more Tintin! =
